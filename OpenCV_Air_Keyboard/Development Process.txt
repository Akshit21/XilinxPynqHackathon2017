OpenCV Air Keyboard

Git: https://github.com/ChaseStewart/XilinxPynqHackathon2017

This is a Virtual Piano player built on a Xilinx FPGA PYNQ board The project demonstrates real time audio/video processing capabililties of the board

The project revolves around PYNQ. We have used OpenCV to process video and PYNQ's Audio pipeline to stream Audio Output. We use Logitech Camera to stream Video at 720p and process it. The Monitor displays the virtual Keyboard on which user can point to the key to be pressed. The PYNQ detects the motion, extracts the image and contours it. It looks into the predefined data base and maps correct note to the corresponding key and loads it to the audio buffer which is streamed out of AUDIO out.
